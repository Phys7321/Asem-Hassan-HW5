Programs look good. I'm really surprised that the IBM random # generator performed as badly as it did - got a little better results. I was impressed with the thoroughness of the last problem - that one is tough, especially since you did it the hard way. The easier way? Well, you could draw from an exponential distribution and then subtract it from 1 to draw from a 1-exp distribution.
